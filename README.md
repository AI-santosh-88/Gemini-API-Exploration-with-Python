# TITLE: Gemini API Exploration with Python
## Description:
This project demonstrates the use of the Gemini API from Google AI using Python. It covers various functionalities, including generating text, listing available models, and analyzing images. It also highlights the use of Markdown for formatted output, image processing with PIL (Pillow), and error handling.
## Responsibilities:
* Setting up the Gemini API environment in Python.
* Making API calls to generate text content (e.g., job roles, tourist destinations).
* Listing and inspecting available Gemini models.
* Downloading and processing images using PIL (Pillow).
* Sending images to the Gemini API for analysis and description.
* Formatting output using Markdown for better readability in notebooks.
* Handling potential errors during image processing.
## Libraries:
### 1. os:
For environment variables
### 2. google-generativeai:
For interacting with the Gemini API
### 3. IPython.display:
For displaying Markdown and images in notebooks
### 4. PIL (Pillow):
For image processing
### 5. requests/curl:
